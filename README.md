LASER SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION in PULSED EMISSION MODE

The main objective of this work is to investigate the technical limitations of a generic laser source operating in pulsed (PW) emission mode. 
In particular, the differences between the control signal and the laser emission signal are compared in terms of delay time $τ_{delay}$, rise time $τ_{rise}$ and fall time $τ_{fall}$.
